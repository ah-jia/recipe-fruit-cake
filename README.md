![Ready to serve photo](images/change this to filename in images folder.jpg)

## Ingredients
- 15 oz butter, softened slightly
- 10 egg yolks
- 6 egg whites
- 12 oz soft brown sugar (prefer to reduce to 10 oz)
- 12 oz plain flour

## Fruits & Nut
- 2 oz chopped almond
- 18 oz currant
- 4 oz lemon peel
- 3 oz glaced cherries, diced

Soak the dried fruits in 4 tablespoons brandy for 3-7 days (or longer).  If preferred, can opt for ready mixed fruits.

### Steps
1. Using a stand mixer, beat the butter and sugar till creamy.  (use medium speed)
2. Add in the eggs gradually.  (recommended 2 eggs at a time & should lower the speed to low until the eggs are just incorporated, then turn speed up to medium & run for a while. Repeat till all the eggs are used up)
3. Turn speed to the lowest possible, add in the flour (easier than folding the flour with a spatula by hand)
4. Continue adding the seasoned dried fruits and almonds.
5. Pour into a 9-inch square tin, bake in a preheated oven of 175 deg C for 45 min , lower temp to 160 deg C and bake for a further 30 min.

** This recipe can also fit into 2 x 8-inch round tin or make into 200 pcs mini cup cakes.**
